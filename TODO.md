# TODO

- [x] Add config file
- [x] Add include/exclude configs
- [X] Use globs for incude/exclude
- [ ] Add watch mode?
- [ ] Better error messages for wrong file types (.js without allowJs)
- [ ] Module aliases (e.g. alias your library name to your src directory)
- [ ] Custom preludes (to avoid repeating imports every snippet)
- [X] File path markdown meta (avoid polluting shippet with file name comment)
- [ ] Handle duplicate file names (e.g. multiple snippet examples of the same config file)
- [ ] Proper library support (main should point to lib index file not src index)
- [ ] Handle diagnostic message chains (sometimes the virtual file name is displayed in message chains)
